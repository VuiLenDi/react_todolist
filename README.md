# React - Redux example structure example

## About
Sometime, we hard to remember structure of React, and step by step to build correctly

Please view picture I've already put on: react_redux_full_map_step.jpg

First of all, please view package.json to know what package we used on this project.
Secondly, Please read below document to know exactly we will do with React, and Redux:

- Book: React and React Native - Adam Boduch
- 30 clips of Egghead: https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree
- Redux: http://redux.js.org
- Redux saga: https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga

And of course, please don't forget official page of React: https://reactjs.org/

## How to build and run
This project, I built with react-scripts module that help us build react quickly
And I will use react-redux to manage state

Step 1: npm install

Step 2: npm start

That's all to start project

## Basic structure and thinking.
When start project with React-Redux, you must think and have plan for each component.
You must split your functionality, and your web into components
*Thumb rule: Never break more than 3 layers.

Please view my structure, and picture, thinking, and if you have any question please ask me.
